                        <p style="text-align:justify">Teaching piano (or teaching in general) requires a lot of creativity, imagination, trial and (unfortunately) error. Besides, most of the strategies we use when teaching piano are the strategies and methodologies that we ourselves have received from others. But what happens if we lacked good quality lessons in the beginning, encounter problems we never had as pupils or simply lack teaching experience and relevant resources?</p>

From unhealthy posture/technique to demotivation, frustration and even giving up on the instrument altogether.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">These strategies will help pupils build a foundation for their performing career as well as their own strategies or "keys to teach" in the future.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">Keys to Teach is a collection of tools and resources intended to support teachers and instructors of piano with their lesson. These keys or resources come from a range of different sources and do not intend to impose any' 'right' or 'wrong' way to teach the piano but rather to offer a variety of strategies from which to choose and experiment with. Supervision from a professional instructor is recommended in order to avoid any kind of injury or bad pianistic habits.
